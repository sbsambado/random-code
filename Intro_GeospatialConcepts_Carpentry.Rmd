### Setup

common packages you'll need
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(terra)
library(rasterVis)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(Rcpp)
library(sp)
library(remotes)
library(sf)


## make sure to set sf to binary
#install.packages("sf",type="mac.binary")


## some other things I tried
#install.packages('terra', repos='https://rspatial.r-universe.dev')

#remotes::install_github("rspatial/terra")

```

### Data Structures: Raster and Vector

*Raster* data is stored as a grid of values which are rendered on a map as pixels
+ each pixel represents an area on Earth's surface

*Vector* data structures represent specific features on the Earth's surface, and assign attributes to those features


#### About Raster Data

+ raster data is gridded data where each pixel is associated with specific geographic location
+ value of pixel can be continuous (i.e. elevation) or categorical (i.e. land use)
+ geospatial raster is only different from a digital photo is that it's accompanied by spatial information that connects data to a particular location
  + like raster's extent and cell size, # of rows & column, and its coordinate reference system (CRS)

```{r}

```

*Important Attributes of Raster Data*

**Extent** : geographic area that the raster data covers. The spatial extent of an R spatial object represents the geographic edge or location that is the furthest north, south,east, and west. Extent represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

**Resolution** : A resolution of a raster represents the area onthe ground that each pixel of the raster covers. Lower the number, higher the resolution.

#### Raster data format for this workshop
+ this workship with use GeoTIFF (.tiff)
+ .tiff file stores metadata or attributes about the file embedded (tif tags)
+ a GeoTIFF is a standard .tif image format with additional spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the file as tags. These tags should include the following raster metadata:
 + 1. extent
 + 2. resolution
 + 3. coordinate reference system (CRS)
 + 4. values that represent missing data (NoDataValue)
 
**More resources on .tif format**

### Multi-band raster data
A raster can contain 1+ bands.
+ one type of multi-band raster dataset = color image (consists of three bands: red, green, blue). The pixel brightness for each band, when composited creates the color that we see in the image.

![color bands](./color bands.png)
In multi-bands dataset, the rasters will always have the same extent, resolution, and CRS

*Other types of multi-band raster data*
+ 1. Time series: same variable, over same area, over time. 
+ 2. Multi or hyperspectral imagery: image rasters that have 4+ (multi-spectral) or 10+ (hyperspectral) bands


### Key Points
+ Raster data is pixelated data where each pixel is associated with a specific location
+ raster data always has an extent and resolution
+ extent is the geographical area covered by a raster
+ resolution is area covered by each pixel of a raster
